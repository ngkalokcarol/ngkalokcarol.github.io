# Data Science Projects

## Machine Learning

#### [ Spam Emails detection](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/spam_email_detection)

Supervised Machine Learning with dataset labelled as Spam (Class 1) and Non-Spam (Class 0). Built a classification model to predict and classify emails that are potentially Spam.  

<i> Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, xgboost</i>

#### [ Marketing Campaign Optimization](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/Marketing_Campaign_optimization)

Supervised Machine Learning with dataset labelled as 'Yes' and 'No' regarding whether customers bought a Term Deposit after the Direct Marketing Call. In this project Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted to identify the patterns and a classification model is built to optimize sales call activity to develop future strategies with the goal to achieve a greater effectivenesss of future marketing calls. 

<i> Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost</i>

#### [ Dogs or Cats Image Classification](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/Dogs_or_Cats_image_classification)

Image classification exercise on Kaggle. Used CNN and Transfer Learning to train the model and classify 25k images of cats and dogs.

#### [ Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/santander_customer_transaction_prediction)

This project predicts a numeric output - Customer Transaction. We tested mutiple models and evaulated why LightGBM is chosen. 

#### [ Shallow or Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/Shallow_VS_Deep_NeuralNetwork)

Train 3 versions of Neural Network, with different numbers of hidden layer (NN with 1 hidden layer, 2 hidden layers and 3 hidden layers), using Mean squared error as objective function and error measurement.

#### [ Cost Aware A/B Testing](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/Cost-Aware_A-B-Testing)

Formulate the above problem into a specific reinforcement learning problem. Clearly define and articulate the agent, environment, actions, rewards, and the agent's objective, etc. Create a simulation environment for this problem. This means manually picking some values for the treatment effects, number of subjects, and how the realized treatment effect for each subject should be generated

Tools: scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib


## Natural Language Processing

#### [ NLP_imdb_review_classification](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/NLP_imdb_review_classification)

For the project I used the IMDB review data and performed BERT classifier and text transformer to train a sentiment analysis model.

Tools: tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, transformers, BERT, BertTokenizer

## Big Data Architecture, Data Analysis and Visualisation

#### [ AWS S3, Redshift, Quicksight, Lambda Dashboard - Iowa Liquor Sales](https://github.com/ngkalokcarol/AWS_S3_Redshift_Lambda_Quicksight_Dashboard_IowaLiquorSales)
